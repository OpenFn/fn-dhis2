# fn-dhis2
This is an adapter for DHIS2, intended to be used with OpenFn, but built to stand alone. This adapter will allow users to insert events and data values to a DHIS2 system using JSON.

It follows the same basic pattern as [fn-salesforce](https://github.com/OpenFn/fn-salesforce):
1. fn-describe (takes `credentials.json` and an object name, returns a destination schema in the form of [JSON-schema](JSON-schema.org))
2. fn-prepare (takes a JSON payload and a destination schema, returns a "plan")
3. fn-push (takes a plan and `credentials.json`, inserts records into DHIS2)

these basic actions are defined in [fn-salesforce/lib/salesforce.rb](https://github.com/OpenFn/fn-salesforce/blob/master/lib/fn/salesforce.rb))

Stu's Thoughts:
-------------------
1. Start with "fn-push" given some JSON, try to insert in DHIS2.
2. Then with "fn-describe" fetch JSON scema for a given object in DHIS2.
3. Finally, "fn-prepare" flattens the JSON push and maps the dependencies â€” this is ready to be inserted piece by piece.

2. [DHIS2 metadata api](https://www.dhis2.org/doc/snapshot/en/developer/html/ch01s06.html): this is needed to fetch JSON-schema compliant schemas for objects that we plan to create or update. Works similar to the "describe" method in [fn-salesforce](https://github.com/OpenFn/fn-salesforce#describe);
